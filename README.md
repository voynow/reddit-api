# reddit_data

12/19/2021
The code developed thus far will serve as infrastructure for getting mass amounts of data from the reddit API. Next I plan to scale this data collection by replacing the .csv data storage with a database. At this point I am still unsure whether or not this database will be relational or unstructured. Being that I have not worked with document style databases before I will have to do some research before I make a decision.
