**1. No discriminatory language or actions towards others.** This includes racism, sexism, transphobia, ageism, ableism. No flaming other users (insulting, name-calling, using discriminatory language).
 
**2. No trolling.** Trolling means posting inflammatory content/posts in an attempt to sow unnecessary discord in the subreddit.
 
**3. No spam, no low-effort shitposts, no off-topic content.** This includes posts begging for upvotes. Please do not post unrelated blog spam or try to sell anything for personal gain. If you've posted content (especially if it's your own), give it a few days before posting again.
 
**4. No alt-right/fascist or incel content.** Do not post/crosspost content that supports alt-right/fascist or incel ideology.

**6. Reposts.** Any content previously posted within the last 30 days will be removed. Same goes for reposts from the subreddit's all-time top 30.
 
**7. No politicians, no CEOs.** Do not post/crosspost content that supports (former or future) political candidates and their campaigns in any way. Take it to r/politics. The same goes for the posting and promotion of CEOs. We don't need bosses and managers to speak for us.

This subreddit was inspired by [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/17q0dd/what_question_are_you_afraid_to_ask_because_you/) thread and more specifically, [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/17q0dd/what_question_are_you_afraid_to_ask_because_you/c880cv5?context=3) comment.

#RULES:

# Rule 1: Top level comments must contain a genuine attempt at an answer

All direct answers to a post must make a genuine attempt to answer the question. Joke responses at the parent-level will be removed. Follow-up questions at the top level are allowed.

Please do not answer by only dropping a link and do not tell users they should ""google it."" Include a summary of the link or answer the question yourself. Users are coming to NSQ for straightforward, simple answers or because of the nuance that engaging in conversation supplies. LMGTFY links will be removed.

No responses being rude to the questioner for not knowing the answer. 

Exceptions: 

- On-topic follow up questions are allowed. 

- Link only answers permitted if the question happens to be ""What is a good subreddit for...?""

#Rule 2: Please try searching here before posting a new question

Try to keep repeat posts to a minimum. As much as we love answering questions here, it doesn't help when we see repeat questions on the front page every day. You can find the questions that have come up here again and again in our [wiki](https://old.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/wiki/index/faq).

#Rule 3: Follow reddiquette 

Be polite and respectful in your exchanges. NSQ is supposed to be a helpful resource for confused redditors. Civil disagreements can happen, but insults should not. Personal attacks, slurs, bigotry, etc. are not permitted at any time.

Check out the [reddiquette](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/reddit-101/reddit-basics/reddiquette) page for more info - violations of any of those of clauses may result in a ban without warning. 

# DISALLOWED QUESTION AREAS

These types of questions are not allowed and will be removed:

- Medical advice questions

- Trolling or joke questions

- Suicide related questions.  Such questions are best handled by the great resources they have at r/SuicideWatch.

- Questions along the lines of ""was I raped?"" or ""was I sexually assaulted?"" are best addressed by the trained, professional support resources you can find [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SeriousConversation/wiki/resources#wiki_rape_and_sexual_violence) or [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/rapecounseling/about/sidebar). 
 
- Getting people to view your product/video/podcast/website by phrasing it in the form of a question

- Illegal things - nothing like ""Where can I find a copy of (movie/show/music) for free online?"" There are other places for asking that, this is not one of them.

- Tasteless or disturbing questions regarding loli, pedophilia, murder, violence or other sketchy or disgusting subject matter are not welcome here. You are welcome to ask good faith questions about such topics but be aware such threads may be locked or removed if necessary to preserve the integrity of the subreddit.

- Other questions not asked in good faith - such as putting a rant or hate towards any group in the form of a question. Any questions we suspect of being leading questions or asked merely to promote an agenda or [sealioning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_lioning) will be removed."

**[Rules and Regulations](#blue2)**

-----

**[[Reddit Global Rules]](https://www.reddit.com/help/contentpolicy/)**


-----

**[The Cardinal Rules](#r1)**

-----

**[1: Doxing:](#blue0) Remove all personal information from your posts and comments. This includes, but may not be limited to, full names, phone numbers, and addresses. A partial exception may be made for public figures, in accordance with the Reddit content policy.**

* **[1.1: Tiktok exemption:](#blue0) Tik tok videos are exempt from this policy due to it being time consuming to censor out a username and the nature of the platform. THIS IS NOT A FREE PASS FOR HARASSMENT.**

**[2: Harassment:](#blue0) Don't target individual users. Don't harass anyone who may be the subject of a post.**

**[3: Brigading:](#blue0) Do not ""invade"" or brigade other subreddits. Do not suggest a brigade or participate in one. This is a permabannable offense. We will catch you.**

* **[3.1: Don't post direct links to other posts:](#blue0) Don't link to other posts on reddit. This enables users of the sub to find posts and harass them.**

**[4: Witch Hunts:](#blue0) Witch hunts of any kind are strictly prohibited.**

**[5: Violence:](#blue0) Do not glorify, encourage, or incite violence, rape or any of the like.**

**[6: Mark Posts NSFW:](#blue0) If your post is in any way NSFW, you must tag your post NSFW. Not doing so may result in your post being taken down.**

* **[6.1: No Pornography:](#blue0) Content may be sexual in nature, but must be overall cringeworthy. Outright pornography is not allowed. If content is posted that shows explicit sexual acts or genitals, your post will be removed and you may be banned.**

* * **[6.1.1: Pain Porn:](#blue0) Pain pornography will result in a severe ban.**

* **[6.2: No linking to porn sites at all.](#blue0) We have no way to police any content on external sites and are not willing to check for CP.**

-----

**[Content Restrictions](#r1)**

-----

**[1: Politics:](#blue0) Do not post any political news snippets/articles/memes. Do not post about policy, allegations, or hearsay. If your post is in any way political in nature it must also include an individual or group actually behaving in an apolitical cringeworthy manner. If you are posting to showcase an agenda, whether to promote it or to mock it, your post will be removed and you will be banned.**

* **[1.1: Identity Politics:](#blue0) If your post predominantly involves topics about race, sex, gender, religion, ethnicity, class, etc. then your post must be focused on cringeworthy behaviour unrelated to the aforementioned topics. If your post is to showcase, mock or promote of any of the above it will be removed and you will be banned.**

* **[1.2: Agendaposting:](#blue0) If it becomes clear that your activity in this subreddit is dominated by fixating on a single issue, political or not, you will be confronted and you may be banned. It is okay to have strong opinions on an issue, but do not let them dominate your activity to the point where you are flooding the sub trying to push an agenda. This is an equal opportunity rule.**

* **[1.3: Be Civil:](#blue0) If you want to discuss politics or controversial/taboo topics in the comments you are free to do so as long as you can keep it civil. Your ideas will not get you banned, but the manner in which you choose to express them can and will.**

**[2: Explicit Racism and Bigotry:](#blue0) Refrain from making comments that are explicitly racist or bigoted. This is not a platform to proselytize race or gender politics. Intent matters here insofar as we are able to judge it, so try to keep your jokes and satire light and in moderately good humor. If your post or comment is found to be racist or bigoted you will be banned without warning.**

**[3: No Outrage Porn:](#blue0) No posts that reasonably/predominantly evoke or are meant to evoke a feeling of anger or hatred. If it fits better in a sub like r/rage or r/iamatotalpieceofshit, do not post it here.**

* [**Examples**](https://old.reddit.com/r/Cringetopia/comments/i03zzg/new_rule_no_posts_that_reasonablypredominantly/#blue0)

**[4: Don't Spam Posts:](#blue0) Spread your posts out. Don't post more than 4-5 things within a 6 hour period. Put some thought into your posts instead of just dumping an entire imgur album on us.**

* **[4.1: No Advertising or Shill Posts:](#blue0) Do not advertise anything on this sub. Do not link to products or push people to buy products or services. You will be met with anywhere up to a permaban.**

* **[4.2: No Manufactured Cringe:](#blue0) Do not post anything that was made for the sake of being cringy. This means content from r/ComedyHitmen and other subs like this. Posting cringebait counts as spam and you will be met with a ban.**

**[5: Banned Content:](#blue0) We prohibit certain content due to these types flooding the sub and being of lower quality or higher concentration. Always check the stickied posts by moderators before posting on /r/Cringetopia; they list banned content that is not allowed. Violating this rule will result in a ban. For more information on banned posts, please see [this](https://redd.it/mvvdp7) post regarding banned content, and  [this](https://redd.it/n7h42v) post regarding meta content.**

**[6: No Sexualizing Minors:](#blue0) No child porn, loli/shota content or sexualizing minors. No joking about child porn, loli content or sexualizing minors. No posting about people that engage in child porn, loli content or sexualizing minors. We are not equipped to deal with monitoring the intent of any post that deals in this subject matter. We have a zero-tolerance policy on posts and comments like these, and will not hesitate to give you a minimum 30 day ban from the sub.**

/r/PublicFreakout/,3707706.0,"##### [Join our Discord Server!](https://discord.gg/tcneqz7)

##About:

A subreddit dedicated to people freaking out, melting down, losing their cool, or being weird in public. Drugged out or sober, anything goes. Keep the comments respectful where mental disorders are concerned, and remember that the individuals depicted in these videos are real people too. This subreddit is essentially dedicated to their worst moments, so do keep that in mind.

Saturated with TV and movies, our brains have become used to watching the imitation of emotions, so much so that it is strangely surprising and fascinating to watch the real thing.

[Source](https://www.reddit.com/r/PublicFreakout/comments/4ou9dl/a_man_wastes_several_days_trying_to_prove_to/d4fljyw)

##Rules:

1. Never post personal information, do not ask for personal information, do not encourage, call for, or participate in witch-hunts or targeted harassment campaigns

2. Comment with tact in videos which may involve mental disorders

3. Abusive comments will be removed at moderator discretion and may result in a temporary or permaban

4.  Bans: Racism, Sexism, Homophobia, Transphobia, Harassment, Race Baiting, Bigotry,  etc. (Racist/bigoted people freaking out in videos are allowed, but being a racist in the comments section will result in a ban.)

5. Video Posts only [exception: Gifs uploaded to reddit or imgur and follow-up news reports]

6. Text Posts (and images of text) may only be posted after moderator approval. Message the mods via modmail before making a post of that nature.

7. Reposts over 4 weeks old are permitted.  Reposts under 4 weeks old will be removed.

8. This isn't /r/watchpeopledie: People being straight up murdered or dying in shocking/gruesome ways should be the cut-off  (exceptions for newsworthy events covered in publications of good repute).

9. Facebook Videos are allowed, but not encouraged. If you must post a video hosted on Facebook, you need to provide a link to a copy of the video hosted on a more acceptable video hosting platform. For videos under 10 minutes [Streamable](https://streamable.com/clipper) makes it easy to make copies of videos.

10. Don't mess with /u/Ezziboo or Mobility Mary.

11. Submissions must fit the purpose of the community. /r/PublicFreakout is a subreddit dedicated to people freaking out, melting down, losing their cool, or being weird in public.

[When you get banned for violating the rules, it has nothing to do with free speech but we do welcome appeals of all moderator decisions via modmail.

##Tags:

**[Mod's Choice]** - The mark of a good find and a quality freakout

* [**Sort by Mod's Choice:Top**](https://www.reddit.com/r/PublicFreakout/search?q=flair%3A%22Mod%27s+Choice%22&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=top&amp;t=all)

Users who submit a ""Mod's Choice"" qualify for permanent custom user flair. You must request the flair for it to be implemented, it is not automatic.

**[Loose Fit]** - A semi-public freakout and passable submission. Not entirely in keeping with the general theme: spatially-situated freakouts occurring in person and in public

**[Repost]** - While they have their place, avoid making these submissions consistently

**[Follow Up]**- A news article or other report which follows up on a video that was previously posted to the subreddit. Please include a link to the original freakout if possible. 

**[Protest Freakout]** - Videos of Protests and the Freakouts that occur during the protest.

**[Compilation]** - A compilation of freakouts

**[Possibly Fake]** - Might have been staged

##Avoid:

**[Fake]** - Staged freakouts

**[Non-Public]** - Non-public freakouts

**[Non-Freakout]** - Submissions that are not freakouts

##Filters:

[Filter out submissions with 'Protest Freakout' flair/tag.

/r/ThatsInsane/,1143166.0,"## Rules

1. **Only ""ThatsInsane"" content**. This subreddit is for things that are a little bit more wild, crazy, scary, creepy, terrifying and incredible than the average. And for stuff that is generally insane! Fake content does not qualify as ""Insane content"". Please have in mind that insane content does not need to be very interesting. And insane people on Twitter and Facebook is ok. Think before submitting, would I find this post ""ThatsInsane"" if it would be someone else who posted it. Posts should be able to elicit a reaction of ""ThatsInsane"" from viewers.

2. **No Racism and Hate speech**. Racism and hate speech will be removed and the poster will be banned. No questions asked.

3. **No pornography**.

4. **Moderator Discretion**. Posts are at the discretion of the moderators. If we do not believe it fits the sub, or think it is spam, we will remove it.

6. **Image w/ text posts must be sourced in comments**. Image w/ text posts must have a linked and credible source that backs up the information.

7. **Use descriptive titles**. Non-descripted titles will be removed. Titles must describe the content, not your feelings or reactions to the content. ""insane"" or ""this is crazy"" is not a proper description.

#General Information

* Everybody is welcome here, even those that have yet to ascend.
* Every kind of PC related content is welcome here. This includes build help, tech support, and any kind of doubt one might have about PC ownership.
* You don't necessarily need a PC to be a member of the PCMR. You just have to love PCs. It's not about the hardware in your rig, but [the software in your heart!](//twitter.com/PedroPCMR/status/570009579637092352)
* This is not a satirical or 'circlejerk subreddit'. [Nor did it start as one](//pcmasterrace.org/history). This is a [normal subreddit with occasional tongue-in-cheek humor elements](//pcmasterrace.org/community). We are a community where many of its members share similar opinions about the main topics, and sometimes end up having private jokes amongst ourselves.  We are not a community where members feign stupidity when posting and commenting because they find it funny. You can be banned if you conduct yourself like that here.
* Owning a console does not necessarily make you a ['peasant'](//pcmasterrace.org/consolepeasants).
* We created Reddit's most popular [Wiki](/r/pcmasterrace/w/).
* If needed, you can [message the team behind PCMR](//reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/pcmasterrace).

#Giveaway Rules

For an in-depth explanation of our giveaway rules don't forget to check our [rules wiki page](/r/pcmasterrace/w/rules#wiki_giveaway_rules).

* The Master Race is generous. When doing giveaways please keep it within the bounds of our subreddit and only for subreddit members. Feel free to give prizes as you see fit, but don't mandate subscriptions or other benefits. You can post about your channel or project, but don't make it a requirement to visit, comment or subscribe to an external place to enter a giveaway or to increase the likelihood of winning.
* Under special circumstances, we allow giveaways to be external and/or to require users to visit a page outside the subreddit, but that must conform to our [outside giveaway guidelines](/r/pcmasterrace/wiki/rules#wiki_outside_giveaway_guidelines).
* Even if you do a giveaway, you can not directly promote a specific giveaway happening elsewhere without prior mod approval.
* Please [avoid posting keys in plain text or on images](/3ys6wv). Consider PMs as a safer way to hand out keys.
* Users giving away physical items must provide photo proof of ownership (including their username and date) in the giveaway thread. Shipping fees must be entirely financed by the user doing the giveaway (limiting the winner's location is allowed).
* No conditional (I will only giveaway if) giveaways. If you start it, someone must win it. You cannot delete your giveaway once you post it.
* Giveaways shouldn't last an absurd amount of time, nor should they be absurdly difficult to enter or win.
* Do not choose your giveaway winners based on the number of upvotes or downvotes they get.
* Giveaways to benefit registered charities must be verified by moderators. All other requests for donations (monetary or otherwise) are not allowed as per rule #8.
* Only one entry per user to any giveaway unless otherwise stated by the giveaway poster.

A place to post the most interesting stuff on the web!"
/r/AmItheAsshole/,3342138.0,"#Welcome to r/AmITheAsshole!

A catharsis for the frustrated moral philosopher in all of us, and a place to finally find out if you were wrong in a real-world argument that's been bothering you. Tell us about any non-violent conflict you have experienced; give us both sides of the story, and find out if you're right, or you're the asshole.

This is the sub to lay out your  actions and conflicts and get impartial judgment rendered against you.  Were you the asshole in that situation or not? Post should reflect real situations, and abide by the rules below.

After 18 hours, your post will be given a flair representing the final judgment on your matter.  This flair is determined by the subscribers who have both rendered judgment and voted on which judgment is best.  ***The power of the crowd will judge you***.  If your top level comment has the highest number of upvotes in a thread, you will get a flair point. More details are listed in [our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq).

#Voting Guide

If you are commenting, be sure to start your comment with the abbreviation for your judgment, i.e.

**YTA** = You're the Asshole; 

**NTA** = Not the A-hole; 

**ESH** = Everyone Sucks here;
 
**NAH** = No A-holes here; 

**INFO** = Not Enough Info 

---

#**Rules**

##1. Be Civil

Attack ideas, not people. The purpose of this space is to determine and explain who is in the wrong, not to eviscerate anyone. Treat others with respect while helping them grow through outside perspectives.

This rule applies to everyone (even those outside of Reddit). Don't insult others or get into prolonged spats in the comments. Don't lecture people about the rules (use reports).

Be respectful. Be nice. Don't be an asshole.

##2. Voting Rules

Upvote posts that make for an interesting discussion. **DON'T** downvote if you think OP is an asshole. **DON'T DOWNVOTE COMMENTS YOU DISAGREE WITH.** Downvotes should be reserved for off-topic discussions or spam. Report harassing comments, don’t engage. 

Don't participate in threads you have found through crossposts and links outside of this subreddit. In this sub, your comment is a vote. Brigading/Vote manipulation is against Reddit site wide rules. **Brigading will earn a permanent ban.**

##3. Accept Your Judgment

This sub is here for the submitter to discover what everyone else thinks of the ethics or mores of a situation. It is not here to draw people into an argument you want to have, or to defend your position. If people start saying you were the asshole, do not take that as an invitation to debate them on the subject... accept the judgment and move on. If you have valid reason to think a commenter needs more information or misunderstood the facts of the conflict, you may give new information.

##4. Never Delete An Active Discussion

DO NOT delete your submission once a discussion has begun. Your post must stay up for **at least 48 hours**. We encourage submitters to use throwaways to maintain their privacy, but deleting a discussion is unacceptable. Violators will be banned.

##5. No Violence

Don't even *mention* violence.

If your post or comment references violence, don't share it here. Any hint, mention, euphemism or suggestion of violence falls under this rule and isn't allowed.

Comments and even jokes about violence are not tolerated. Encouraging self-harm, suicide, ""bad karma,"" property damage, food tampering, or anything that wishes mental or physical pain on anyone is strictly prohibited. **Violating this rule will result in a permanent ban.**

##6. How To Post

The TITLE of your submission must begin with the acronym AITA or WIBTA (would I be the asshole?), then a description of the situation.

Posts are limited to 3000 characters. Paragraphs are good; block text walls are bad. Format and punctuate your post reasonably. Be clear and concise. Don't link to screenshots or other subreddits. If you can't explain yourself in one post, without using external text pages, it does not belong here. Do not use someone else's account or a shared account.

##7. Post Interpersonal Conflicts

Posts should be descriptions of recent interpersonal conflicts. Describe both sides in detail. Make it clear why you may be ""the asshole.""

Submissions must contain a real-life conflict between you and at least one other person. They should not be about feelings, opinions, or desires. If your conflict is with a larger demographic, an animal, someone online, or a third party who’s irrelevant to the main question but thought what you did sucked, your post will be removed.

##8. No Shitposts

Posts must be truthful and presented as fairly and accurately as possible.

This is not a humor sub. This is not a sub for copypastas, satire, overly embellished stories, or creative writing exercises. Don't copy someone else's story and post it from the opposite viewpoint or with some details changed.

Shitposting will result in a permanent ban.

##9. Do Not Ask For Advice

This is NOT an advice sub. All submissions that ask for advice (instead of or in addition to judgment) will be removed. This sub is for arbitration.

You may include advice when you make your comments, but remember that your primary objective in commenting is to assign blame and pass judgment.

If a thread's focus becomes about advice instead of arbitration the thread may be removed regardless of the OP's intent.

##10. Updates and META posts are restricted

If you want to discuss this sub in any way, please reserve this discussion for* the monthly open forum. Any META posts will be removed and may result in a ban.

Update posts require approval. Please review the [update criteria](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq#wiki_can_i_post_an_update_on_my_thread.3F) and contact the mod team for approval. Unapproved updates will result in a ban.


##11. No Partings/Relationship/Sex/Reproductive Autonomy Posts

We do not allow posts where the central conflict is about familial or platonic partings, relationships, and/or reproductive autonomy.

The following posts are forever banned:

AITA for breaking up with/ghosting/cutting contact with _ (or not)

AITA for dating _ (or not)

AITA for doing sexual act _ (or not)

AITA for being attracted to _ (or not)

Any reproductive autonomy decision

Any posts related to cheating- including ""telling on"" someone for cheating (or not).

And similar.

##12. This Is Not A Debate Sub

If judgment is primarily motivated by whether commenters agree with your stance on a broad issue it is not appropriate for this sub. This includes anything from politically motivated conflicts to innocuous issues like if cake is better than pie. If you're ultimately asking if it is okay to kick someone off your team for their sexual identity, stop talking to your friend because they vape, or any similar debate, your post will be removed.

No starting off topic debates about marginalized groups

##13. No Revenge Stories

There are many subreddits for sharing tales of revenge—this is not one of them. This is a sub for providing feedback on interpersonal conflict, not for endorsing how you escalate a conflict. If you're here to tell us how you punished someone who totally had it coming, you're probably breaking this rule.

##14. No COVID posts

Posts about transmitting or contracting COVID are banned. For more information, view this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/g91gtl/coronavirus_post_moratorium_updated/)

###Before posting 

* Make sure to [ read the rules!](https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/wiki/detailed_rules)

* This subreddit is for asking for objective explanations. It is not a repository for any question you may have.

* E is for Explain - merely answering a question is not enough.

* LI5 means friendly, simplified and layperson-accessible explanations - not responses aimed at literal five-year-olds.

* Perform a keyword search, you may find good explanations in past threads. You should also consider looking for your question in the FAQ.

* Don't post to argue a point of view.


* Flair your question after you've submitted it.

[](#header)

**Does your post qualify for /r/MildlyInteresting? Hover below for more info, and check out our [wiki page](/r/mildlyinteresting/wiki)!**

-----
&gt; ### 1. No memes 
&gt; This includes references in titles of your post (e.g. ""banana for scale,"" ""potato quality"").

----- 

&gt; ### 2. No related posts
&gt; Posts that acknowledge, ""one-up,"" or relate specifically to another post are not allowed (e.g. ""I see your X and raise you Y"")

-----

&gt; ###3. No x-posts or reposts
&gt; Do not post something that has been submitted anywhere on reddit before (including here), even if you were the one who posted it.

&gt; **Exception:** If a post is deleted or removed from /r/mildlyinteresting for breaking the rules less than one hour after being submitted or receives less than 100 upvotes, we allow the submitter to resubmit a fixed version of the post. Posts deleted or removed from other subreddits are not exempt from rule 3. 

----- 

&gt; ###4. Original [OC] photographs only
&gt; **a.** No gifs, videos, or websites.  

&gt; **b.** All submissions must be original content. If you didn't take the photo, don't post it.  

&gt; **c.** Software glitches/errors, overlaid text, arrows, scribbles, and other substantive edits are not allowed, although you may censor personal information per Reddit-wide rules.

&gt; **d.** Side by side images are okay if they adhere to the rest of the rules.

-----

&gt; ###5. No screenshots

&gt; No screenshots. We define a screenshot as a screen grab. This means no images of screens, pictures of screens taken with a different device, images that have been partially or fully generated by a computer, or pictures of printed out screenshots. Try /r/screenshots!. 

-----

&gt; ###6. Titles must be an exact but concise description of the content
&gt; **a.** Titles must not contain jokes, backstory, or other fluff. That information belongs in a follow-up comment.  

&gt; **b.** Titles must exactly describe the content. It should act as a ""spoiler"" for the image. If your title leaves people surprised at the content within, it breaks the rule!

&gt; **c.** Titles must not contain emoticons, emojis, or special characters unless they are absolutely necessary in describing the image. (e.g. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°), ;P, 😜, ❤, ★, ✿ )

&gt; *Still confused? For more elaboration and examples, see [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/mildlyinteresting/comments/21p15y/rule_6_for_dummies/) first and then [message the mods](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fmildlyinteresting) if you still have questions.*

###About \/r/Videos [chat](https://discord.gg/videos#dis)
* A great place for video content of all kinds. Direct links to major video sites are preferred (e.g. YouTube, Vimeo, etc.)

---
###Rules [detailed rules](/r/videos/wiki/rules#rules) 

#0. Videos Only
* Self explanatory. Audio over a static image or slideshow may also violate Rule 0.

*  This includes music visualizers and lyric videos

#1. No Politics
* Political videos—including content relating to [social issues which have a clear political element](https://www.reddit.com/r/videos/wiki/rules#wiki_rule_1_-_no_politics)—should be submitted to /r/PoliticalVideo. 

* This includes submissions of current or recent political figures in any context, satire/political-comedy, and posts on political topics from within the last **10 years**.  (So a video of Winston Churchill playing tennis would be allowed, but a video of Theresa May playing ping-pong would not be.)

#2. No Personal Information or Witch-Hunting
* **Or incitement to witch-hunt.**

* No demanding ""Reddit Justice"" (or even regular justice) in any way in post titles or comments.

* Do not post names, Facebook pages, phone numbers, addresses, etc. Fake information (false@fake.com, 123 fake street, etc) also falls under this rule.

* This may also include contact information of public officials, businesses, or groups (e.g. politicians or police officers) in an any manner that could be seen as an attempt to get users to contact them.

* Facebook links are not permitted. In order to have your post accepted, if you can, find or submit a copy of the video on another website like YouTube or Vimeo and resubmit it.

* **This is grounds for an immediate (and likely permanent) ban, so consider this your only warning.**

#3. Submit Direct Link to Video

* No web pages that only embed Youtube or Vimeo videos. 

* No URL shorteners. 

* No links to playlists or to channel pages.

#4. No Porn, Gore, or Death.

* There are many other subreddits and websites that cater for that content.

#5. No Solicitation of Votes or Views

* No asking for votes or sharing submission links on or off-site. See [Reddiquette](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette) for more details.

* Do not ask other users to follow your social media profiles in comments or submission titles.

* Titles for posts should not try to influence users to view or upvote them. Examples of this include things like ""this person deserves more views,"" ""not enough people have seen this person's videos,"" or ""show this person some love.""

* Giveaways also fall under this rule

* Violations can lead to a permanent ban of accounts and video channels.

#6. No Hate Speech

* You are free to offer your opinion respectfully, but comments or posts intended to demean a group, acontextual expressions of bigotry, and the pejorative use of slurs is disallowed.

* **Baiting users into breaking this rule is not allowed.**

* Telling other users to hurt or kill themselves in any form is against reddit TOS, and will earn you a permanent ban.

* Be kind to users in our community; [remember the human.](https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/1ytp7q/remember_the_human/)

#7. No Videos of Assault/Battery or Public Freakouts

* No videos of real-life, malicious person-on-person assault/battery or physical abuse of animals. 

* This includes raw videos of fights and malicious violence.

* This includes videos of child and animal abuse.

* This includes raw videos of fights, police brutality/harassment, and malicious violence.

* Public freakout videos belong in /r/PublicFreakout

#8. No Third Party Licensing

* No videos that are licensed by a third party. 

* If the video description says: 'for licensing enquiries contact licensing@agency.com', the video is most likely licensed by a third party. If the video has a watermark, it also may be licensed by a third party. 

* Videos that become licensed after they are posted will be removed. Please see [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/3mvfy4/important_information_regarding_3rd_party/) for a more detailed explanation.

* Third-Party Licensing firms are often scams. [Report any messages you receive of suspicious offers to the moderator team.
](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fvideos)

#9. No Self Promotion

* *""It's perfectly fine to be a redditor with a youtube channel, it's not okay to be a youtube channel with a reddit account.""* - Confucius

* r/videos is not a platform for you to promote your own content, whilst we do allow OC, any indication that you are heavily pushing your channel on the sub (be it by yourself or a distributed effort) will be met with submission removals and can lead to both a ban from the sub and a permanent sub-wide youtube channel blacklisting.

###Moderation [message the mods](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/videos#mods)

#Removals &amp; Warnings
* If your submission does not appear in the [new queue,](http://www.reddit.com/r/videos/new/) please [contact us](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/videos) (be sure to **include a link to the Reddit post** (i.e. comments section), not the content you are linking). Simply deleting your post may cause the spam filter to catch future ones.

* *Note: Submissions from new users, and users with low karma, are automatically removed to help prevent spam.*

* Also, please contact us regarding spam, political or any other inappropriate videos, as this helps us remove them more quickly! When reporting, please explain why you think it should be removed. 

* **Do not** message moderators individually about posts not appearing in the new queue or ban appeals. Messages should be sent as a modmail to /r/Videos. Failure to do so may result in a ban.


#Submit Feedback

 * Send us a mod mail anytime or head to our Discord linked above.

&gt; **DON'T BE AN ASSHOLE.**

&gt; **Unsure if the rules apply to you for your post/comment? [Click here.](http://i.imgur.com/m8mbW4i.gif)**
&gt;
&gt;  * [](#icon-information) [Message the moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAskMen) with any questions/comments.  This includes external sites looking to farm responses for content. NO SURVEYS.

&gt;  * [](#icon-information) **Read the [Frequently Asked Questions](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/wiki/index) wiki and do a search before asking a question.**

&gt;  * [](#icon-information) **We do not allow questions/comments from throwaways or accounts with low karma (&lt; 5 for comments, &lt; 10 for posts).** Participate elsewhere on Reddit to gain experience and karma before trying to post here.

&gt;  * [](#icon-information) **Be respectful.** Anyone is allowed to ask and answer questions. Do not insult or troll people, including in PMs.

&gt;  * [](#icon-information) **Don't comment/post self-deprecating content looking for attention.**  First warning is a temp ban, second warning is a permaban.  If you want to be a sad sack and complain about your life, go to /r/rant or /r/ForeverAlone 



--------

&gt; ###Post Guidelines:

&gt; * [](#icon-information) **The title of your post must contain an actual question.**  Keep your question concise.

&gt; * [](#icon-cross) **Do not make posts asking about someone's/some group's actions, behavior, or thinking.** We're not fucking psychic. Go fucking ask them yourself.

&gt; * [](#icon-cross) **Do not post pictures or ask questions looking for affirmation of your appearance or body features.** That includes boobs, butts, and your weird eyebrows. Seriously, we're gonna remove this shit.

&gt; * [](#icon-cross) **Do not ask yes/no or one word answer questions.** This is not a fucking optional rule. If you are wondering if it applies to you, it does.

&gt; * **No clickbait** (i.e. ""What do you think of this?"").

&gt; * [](#icon-cross) **Do not post negative/forever alone rants or whiny posts.**  Visit /r/ForeverAlone or /r/rant if you want to complain.

&gt; * [](#icon-cross) **Do not ask for gift ideas; visit /r/gifts.** You can't think of a gift idea? Neither can we lol

&gt; * [](#icon-cross) **Do not complain about other subs here,** we're not your 1-800 hotline for issues with them.

&gt; * [](#icon-cross) **Do not post just to push an agenda.** If you repeatedly ignore this, we will ban you.

&gt; * [](#icon-cross) **Do not directly link to comments in other subs.**

&gt; * [](#icon-cross) **Medical advice is not allowed here.**  We recommend talking to a medical professional instead of the Internet.

&gt; * [](#icon-cross) **Overly political questions will be removed.**  There are subs like /r/politics and /r/PoliticalDiscussion if you want to debate political ideas or candidates.

&gt; * [](#icon-information) **Frequently asked questions will be removed at our discretion.** Search the subreddit. Do not storm into the modmail with a bad attitude if this is the removal reason.

&gt; * Sometimes automod fucks up - if you think it did, you can message us, but if you roll up to the modmail with a fucking attitude, we're not going to indulge you."

#Rules:

##1. Submissions

* ####Guidelines:

* Submissions must be primarily news and developments relating to technology

* Self posts must contribute positively to /r/technology and foster reasonable discussion. Self-post cross-posts are not acceptable.

* Submissions relating to business and politics must be sufficiently within the context of technology in that they either view the events from a technological standpoint or analyse the repercussions in the technological world.

* ####Please do not submit the following:

* i) Submissions violating the guidelines.

* ii) Images, audio or videos: Articles with supporting image and video content are allowed; if the text is only there to explain the media, then it is not suitable. A good rule of thumb is to look at the URL; if it's a video hosting site, or mentions `video` in the URL, it's not suitable. 

* iii) Requests for tech support, questions or help: submit to /r/techsupport, /r/AskTechnology, another relevant community or our weekly [Support Saturday threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/search?q=flair%3ATechSupport&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all).

* iv) Petitions, Surveys or Crowdfunding (Including ICOs) - submissions of this nature will be removed.

* v) Submissions discussing the subreddit itself; they should be submitted to /r/TechnologyTalk, or [messaged to the moderators of the subreddit](/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Ftechnology).

* vi) Submissions discussing one or more incidents of customer support.

* vii) Mobile versions of sites, url shorteners: please directly submit the desktop version of a webpage in all cases.

* viii) Social media links/profiles/invites or promotions (eg. Facebook, Instagram, Pintrest etc). Tweets should not be used as a news source unless an official announcement by a verified company or spokesperson. 

##2. Behaviour

* **Remember the human** You are advised to abide by [reddiquette](/wiki/reddiquette); it will be enforced when user behaviour is no longer deemed to be suitable for a technology forum. Remember; personal attacks, abusive language, trolling or bigotry in any form are therefore not allowed and will be removed. Repeated abuse can result in a permanent ban.

##3. Titles

* Submissions **must** use either the articles title and optionally a subtitle. Or, ***only*** if neither are accurate, a suitable quote, which must:

* adequately describe the content

* adequately describe the content's relation to technology

* be free of user editorialization or alteration of meaning. 

##4. Flair

* Please flair your submission appropriately. [An extended guide to flairing can be found here, in the wiki](/r/technology/wiki/flair).

##5. Reddit-wide rules.

* [All reddit-wide rules apply here](/rules). Do not [spam](/wiki/faq#wiki_what_constitutes_spam.3F).

***

##Miscellanea

* If you see a rule-breaking submission, please report it and [message the moderators](/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Ftechnology) with your reason.

* Want to host an AMA? Please [message the moderators](/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Ftechnology).

* Our /u/AutoModerator configuration may be viewed [here](https://imgur.com/a/EOi0n). 

* Removed postss will either be given a removal reason flair and/or comment response; please message the moderators if this did not occur.

* All legitimate, answerable modmail inquiries or suggestions will be answered to the best of our abilities within a reasonable period of time.

/r/TrueOffMyChest/,1111891.0,"# 1. Feel free to speak your mind 

* This is a place where all who want to get something off their chest, can get something off their chest. The Mods at /r/TrueOffMyChest will never enforce any rules that exclude any race/gender/etc. or other views from posting in /r/TrueOffMyChest. We ask that you do the same.

# 2. Do not break sitewide rules

* Due to the nature of this subreddit, telling anyone to kill themselves will be an automatic, permanent ban. This is a place where people come to share some of their darkest secrets, things that might already put them into a volatile mental state. Again, there is a no tolerance policy for this.

* Posts involving pedophilia or minors in sexual situations will likely be removed

* Posts wishing violence on anyone will be removed.

* Begging for karma is against Reddit ToS and will be removed.

# 3. Posts must be on topic

* No Circlejerking - Repeated posts on the same topic within a 24 hour period is considered circlejerking. Please find an active thread on the topic and participate by commenting.

* No blanket statements

* No hot takes

* No impersonal opinions, political or otherwise

* No generalizations

* Obviously fake stories will be removed

* Political topics are fine but they must be in ""off my chest"" fashion.  

* More information on what types of posts are allowed here:  https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/m501ud/what_does_personalized_off_my_chest_style_post/

# 4. Comments must be civil and respectful of OP

* Scolding/insults toward OP is not allowed, no matter what their opinions are. Egregiously breaking this rule may result in a ban.

# 5. Be mature 


* Off-topic comments are rude and will be removed.

* Calm debates are fine,  name-calling and arguing is not. Comments should be well-thought out and reasonable and have the goal of productive conversation with others, even if  there is a disagreement

* Please engage the community in good faith and do not test the limits of the mod team

# 6. Do not disclose personal information about yourself or others 

* Do not reveal personally identifiable information. Consider creating a new reddit account just for your post.

* Do not attempt a witch hunt. This includes referencing another user's reddit history.

* Do not ping users who are not already in the thread. Pinging someone in order to harass them is a bannable offense


We also heavily encourage our users to follow the [reddiquette](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette) 

##Other Information

This subreddit is **not** considered a safe space for any particular group. If you are in need of one, the original /r/offmychest maintains one (Mostly for common safe spaces such as LGBT, Domestic Abuse, Sexual Abuse). All posts, besides blatant trolls or excessive circlejerking, are allowed and we will not take them down.

/r/formuladank/,478661.0,"**BEFORE YOU POST SOME DANK ASS MEMES, HERE ARE SOME RULES BROTHER:**

- This is a sub for F1 memes. Memes related to other motorsports must be labeled [OT] 

- High quality memes only

- Memes not related to motorsport will be removed if the remaining moderator sees it. 

- The mods will deem if posts are quality or not, as well as general users. Low quality WTF1/Facebook Lando Norris tier memes, unironic impact font, 2012 Kimi Memes, and overused memes in general are just a few examples of low quality content that shall be removed immediately.

- Alonso deserved 2012, please remind other users of that 

- Do not bully or harass people. Baiting, calling out users, targeted harassment won't be tolerated.

- Do not spam Lando Norris Instagram it's a pain in the ass to remove it all.

- Memes have to be rated with the Dave Meltzer stars rating. The average Meme begins at 2 stars. The lowest is -5 stars and legendary Memes can be rated up to 5 stars (7 stars if it's in the Tokyo Dome)

- While posts satirizing other subreddits is allowed, it is a violation of sitewide and r/formuladank rules to actively encourage brigades or interference of other subreddits, such as r/formula1 or r/MotoGP.

- Comments and posts that tag other subreddits get automatically deleted per Reddit's request, sorry!"

/r/TooAfraidToAsk/,1403759.0,"Welcome to TooAfraidToAsk, a sub that's dedicated to providing a more open question&amp;answer discussion experience. We allow throwaways and do not remove 'google-able' questions. While your question may have been answered elsewhere, maybe its answer wasn't sufficient, maybe you didn't understand the answer or maybe you are looking for a discussion about the answer. At any rate, your question is welcome here as long as it follows our rules:

**Rule 1 - Be Kind.**

- Consider the human. If you can’t talk to someone with their best interest at heart, do not participate here until you can.

- No advocating violence or harm. Posts or comments about how to harm yourself or others, or advocating violence/harm of any kind, against anyone, are strictly prohibited. See Reddiquitte and site-wide rules for more information.

- No hateful, degrading, malicious, or bigoted speech against any person or group. Violations will face escalating bans, with a 'three strike' policy.

- No question-shaming or personal insults. If you can't think of something kind to say, don’t engage. If you see a question you don’t feel OP should be afraid to ask, or if they’ve asked their question in a way that offends you, don’t insult or shame them. Report rule violations, kindly let them know, downvote, and move on.

**Rule 2 - Be Helpful.**

- Top-level comments must be legitimate attempts to answer the question. Please try to give your best answer, and direct OP to resources to learn more whenever possible. Jokes are permitted in child threads, but must follow our rules.

- Don't argue, de-escalate. If you disagree with someone's answer, ideas, opinions, or sources, feel free to engage in civil conversation. However, if you can’t discuss a topic calmly and kindly---it happens, we all have something that triggers us---do not engage here until you can. If you see an argument beginning, please encourage de-escalation. If it continues, report it, and move on.

- No medical diagnoses. It is, at best, unwise to take medical advice from strangers on the internet, even if they seem knowledgeable. Giving basic first aid advice, directing OP to relevant resources and licensed practitioners, and citing your own experience is permitted. Please be transparent about your sources and credentials, and report violations of this rule to mods.

**Rule 3 - Be Genuine.**

- No soapboxing, trolling, moralising, sealioning, or spamming. Please visit our wiki for more information and examples of what we consider disingenuous content submissions. Posts and comments in violation will face escalating bans, with a 'three strike' policy. Please report rule violations.

- Give OP benefit of the doubt, unless they have proven otherwise. Assume they are asking in good faith; innocent until proven guilty. Please report violations of this rule to mods.

**Rule 4 - Follow the Rules.**

- Submissions must be in the form of a question. Any other necessary information about your query, like your reasoning and background, should go in the body of your post, not the title. Posts in violation will be removed.

- Flair your post. Flair helps people find your question in the future. It also makes it easier for OPs to search for previous iterations of their question, before they submit.

- Search our sub before posting. Our updated submission guidelines ask that OP search for previous versions of their question in our sub's history, prior to submitting. This is to reduce repeat questions &amp; maintain high-quality answers. Frequently asked questions should be referred to our FAQ and reported to mods for review.

- Feel free to suggest ways we can improve. Feedback is incredibly helpful to us. Please be kind when you write in. We are people like you, doing our best.

Check out [our wiki by clicking here](https://www.reddit.com/r/TooAfraidToAsk/wiki/index) if you need further clarification. 

All opinions are welcome as long as they are presented respectfully and follow the above guidelines. Rules here are kept more relaxed than our sister subs intentionally to allow as close to an organic user experience as possible. Automod uses reports to decide if a submission is removed and these are all reviewed by a mod within 24 hours. Bans are typically last resorts and the mod team maintains a strict open-door policy. Do not hesitate to reach out to us about any questions, concerns and/or comments you have about the sub.

# 3. No extreme NSFW-Posts
We don't want to embrace content that is not safe for life. Please tag mildly NSFW-posts with the appropriate tag.

# 4. No Memes
Posts shouldn't be memes or content that belongs on r/funny

#5. No Low-Effort-Content
Content should be somewhat original or good in terms of quality. Low-effort or low-quality content will be removed. This includes screenshots.

# 6. No text only posts
Posts should not contain just text, there must be an image that is hateable accompanying it.

# 7. No Politics
Posts containing politics are not allowed."

#Spoilers

All spoilers must be tagged. The code to make a spoiler in a comment or text post body is:

    [Spoiler source] &gt;!Spoiler goes here!&lt;

[Spoiler source] &gt;!Spoiler goes here!&lt;

* The source of a spoiler (the title of the thing it's spoiling) must be clearly listed immediately before the spoiler in your post or comment, using [] to indicate that.
* Do not post spoilers in the submission title.
* Links to external articles/images with spoilers should have the [Spoiler] flair as well as the name of the show.
* Spoilers can sometimes prove difficult to interpret. If possible, tell us how the comment/thread is a spoiler.
* Source material scenes/info that were left out of the anime are still spoilers. Tag them appropriately.
* If you repeatedly fail to properly use spoiler tags you **will** be banned.

(and don't be a cunt)

**Subreddit Rules**
---

-----

###**1. Don’t violate Reddit's Content Policy**
1. Pretty simple. Don't be racist, homophobic, transphobic, incite violence, etc. Find the content policy [here] (https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy). If you disagree with this, take it up with the admins, because we have no say in them.


###**2. Don't be a cunt**

1. Also simple. If you come to this sub to be a cunt and to argue about politics, religion, etc in an uncivil way, then you will be banned. This is a shitposting sub dammit, not r/politics.


###**3. Shitposts 😃 God awful posts 😡**

1. This subreddit is for shitposts, not gawdawfulposts. and yes, repost chains/blatant karmawhoring posts are godawfulposts, not shitposts. Posting literal shit=ban. [Due to the poll addressing user complaints](https://redd.it/piumy6) the following are now being removed: unoriginal comment baiting posts (AMA, start arguing, ask questions and edit) and CUM spam. 


###**4. Mod discretion**

1. Mods have final say on what content stays or goes. Pursuant to Comb. Civ. C. §22SA{g}{i} We reserve the right to ban users for making our subreddit terrible


###**5. Kevin**

1. Kevin


###**6. No excessive spamming**

1. Pretty easy. Don't spam posts or comments. We are a shitposting sub, but we have *some*, miniscule, standards.


###**7. Number 7**

1. A Bangledeshi 20 year old student was arrested after watching porn, stripping naked and attacking an attendant during a flight. In March 2018, shortly after the Malindo Air flight departed from Kuala Lumpur, the 20 year old started watching pornography on his laptop. As no one seemed to notice or call him out for it, the man began taking his clothes off. At the request of the cabin crew, the student put his clothes back on. But soon, he tried to hug female flight attendants.


###**8. Really, seriously, don’t be a cunt**

1. That whole “don’t be a cunt” thing, just don’t


###**9. Properly mark NSFW and spoilers**

1. im at work 😡what if my boss sees boobies on my screen 🤬. ""idk if it's nsfw/a spoiler or not"" then just mark it anyways.


###**10. Videos must not exceed 1-ish minutes**

1. This is to prevent overly long videos that become a bore to have to look at.

Are you planning on doing any research here? If so, please read our policy on research and such here: https://www.reddit.com/r/dankmemes/wiki/research"
/r/coolguides/,2366044.0,"**Defining a Guide**

Guides are reference materials, how-tos, and/or comparison tables.  It takes both content and layout to make something a guide. The layout or structure of a guide must be that so, when someone is trying to find/reference information from the guide, they can do so logically or simply. If someone has to visually bop around your guide to find what they are looking for, the guide does not pass the layout test. On top of that not all guides are created equal, many technically qualify as guides, but lack substance. Guides are typically laid out in a grid configuration of some sort or sectioned into multiple tables by a category or step of a process. Flow charts and step-by-step guides are considered guides, so are visual references that line up different types of something next to one another other.

**Defining An Infographic**

An infographic is more educational in layout and content, finding something specific on an infographic is not as easy because it is designed to inform through more narrative structures. If your guide is more of a visual essay than a structured table or list, then chances are that is an infographic. Sometimes infographics can masquerade as how-to guides. 

**Remembering That Sometimes It's Grey**
These are the considerations the mod team use when they feel it is appropriate to remove posts. If you have questions message us, if you think a post is not a good one downvote it.

***Subreddit Rules***

**1. Please only post direct links to images of type .png, .jpg, and .jpeg**

**2. Infographics will be removed.**

**3. Nonserious/Comedy Guides Will Be Removed (better suited for /r/shittycoolguides)**

**4. Guides must use either Reddit or Imgur as an image host**

**5. Guides depicting harmful, dangerous, or destructive content will be removed. This includes guides describing the creation of dangerous items/materials and/or guides that are designed with the purpose to harm or hurt others do not fit the culture of this sub and will be removed.** 

If you know the source of your guide, post it in the comments so people can know the true heros!

Many of you might have whole folders of guides, but they are all on similar topics. Please help keep the sub diverse by not saturating the sub with one topic. If you do we may remove some of your posts in the interest of keeping a wide array of topics.

***Lastly, always check the comments for guides. Moderators are not experts in everything so we do not always moderate for accuracy, though there are often one or two people wearing their smarty pants in the comments.***"

&gt;- **No spoilers in titles.**
&gt;- **Use spoiler tags for anything that hasn't been revealed in the anime yet.**
&gt;- **Do not leak spoilers outside of the thread for chapter spoilers.**
&gt;- Please use the button labeled spoiler or put the word ""spoilers"" somewhere in the title for **posts** with spoilers in them.
&gt;- Please put the chapter number in your title until the Official release is out.

&gt;To mark spoilers in **comments**:

&gt;\[Spoiler](/s ""spoiler-text"")
&gt; or
&gt;\&gt;!spoiler-text!&lt;

&gt;will show up as

&gt;[Spoiler](/s ""spoiler-text"")
&gt; or
&gt; &gt;!spoiler-text!&lt;

##**2. No separate posts about the latest chapter for 24 hours after the release**
&gt;- To prevent the subreddit from getting flooded with posts. 
&gt;- The discussion and theories thread are the place to discuss the chapter. You must wait a day to post any other discussions in a thread. [More &gt;&gt;](/r/OnePiece/w/rules)

##**3. Fanart/cosplay must directly link to the source**
&gt;* Use [saucenao.com](http://saucenao.com/)  and [Google Images](https://images.google.com/)  to find the source. [More &gt;&gt;](https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/wiki/rules#wiki_3._fanart.2Fcosplay_must_directly_link_to_the_source)

&gt;- **Don't post links to plain (or slightly edited) panels, pages, screenshots, gifs or scenes from the manga &amp; anime.**
&gt;- If you want to discuss a certain page/scene from the manga/anime please accompany it with an original analysis or discussion provoking questions. Otherwise it is considered a low effort type of post and will be removed. [More &gt;&gt;](/r/OnePiece/w/rules)

##**5. Posts must be directly related to One Piece**
&gt;- The general rule of thumb is that if only a title or caption makes it One Piece related, the post is not allowed. 
&gt;- This includes pictures/videos of things in real life which look similar to something from One Piece.
&gt;- However, this is only a general guideline and the actual enforcement of the rule may vary based on content submitted. [More &gt;&gt;](/r/OnePiece/w/rules)

##**6. Mind our self promotion policy**
&gt; - Self-promotion should be thoughtful, limited, and consistently well received by the community. The [9:1 ratio](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion) should be generally followed.
&gt;- **In addition, Youtube reviews and theorist videos must:**
&gt; 1. Be in a text post format.
&gt; 2. Summarise your video for the community or create new points to further the discussion of the videos.
&gt;- [More &gt;&gt;](https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/wiki/rules#wiki_6._mind_our_self_promotion_policy)

##**7. No memes**
&gt; * Use /r/memepiece. Subscribe to them! Also try /r/WrongPiece
&gt; * Short jokes, and shit-posts are also memes
&gt; * High quality, hand drawn, original content art, that is a meme may sometimes be allowed. See the full rules for examples. [More &gt;&gt;](/r/OnePiece/w/rules)

##**8. No hentai**
&gt; - **No hentai.** Use /r/funpiece (NSFW) for that.
&gt; - Anything too explicit but not necessarily hentai may also be removed. [More &gt;&gt;](/r/OnePiece/w/rules)

##**9. No posts about One Piece games other than news**
&gt; - /r/OnePieceTC exists for One Piece Treasure Cruise
&gt; - Posts for promotion of the game subreddits are allowed, following the self promotion rule. [More &gt;&gt;](/r/OnePiece/w/rules)

##**10. Do not repost questions answered in the FAQ or sidebar**
&gt;- Use the search bar, your search engine, and the [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/wiki/faq) to ensure that you are not reposting recent content or already answered questions. [More &gt;&gt;](/r/OnePiece/w/rules)
&gt;- [Click here for recently asked questions](https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/search?q=flair%3Ahelp&amp;include_over_18=on&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new)

##**11. Don't be a dick**
&gt; * Do not feed the trolls. If you suspect trolling, report and ignore.
&gt; * Trolling, baiting, or (obviously) provocative comments/post may be removed at moderator discretion.
&gt; * Remember [reddiquette](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette). [More &gt;&gt;](/r/OnePiece/w/rules)

/r/iamatotalpieceofshit/,1519237.0,"A place to post social media screenshots or gifs of people acting like a piece of shit. The worst of the worst, people who you wouldn't wish on your worst enemy.

##**Rules:**

1. Take a screenshot and completely **redact all information that can be used to identify a person**. This includes, but is not limited to: **first and last names, usernames (including your own, including the symbol which identifies a commenter as you, including any other people featured in the image, including public accounts), subreddit and online community names, titles of specific posts, and other information like addresses, phone numbers, profile pictures, and license plates.**  If you intentionally post personal information, you will be banned. This is to prevent brigading and harassment, so we take this rule very seriously.  **Do not post reddit screenshots.**
**Do not ask for personal information, suggest someone should be doxxed, link to or comment with personal information, openly solicit personal information, or contact the people featured here. Don't even wax poetic about wanting to post identifying information. You will be banned. There are no exceptions to rule 1.**
2. **Do not encourage, glorify, or incite violence.**  
For example: ""Kill yourself"", ""It wouldn't be so bad if we killed all the pedophiles"", ""This guy needs to die"", ""I hope this guy gets stabbed to death with a rusty screwdriver"", etc. Don't even joke about it, as ""I was kidding"" will not be taken as an excuse.

3. **Must be a total piece of shit**  
A total piece of shit is someone who is intentionally harming people or animals. Bad parking, annoying but harmless things, memes &amp; image macros, trophy hunters, people who put down their pets humanely, short &amp; unoriginal comments, overly political/partisan posts, screenshots of someone's Reddit profile, petty arguments, fights/simple revenge, and common/unoriginal crimes do not belong here. Anti-vaxxer posts rarely belong here.  
If your post isn't shitty enough, it'll be removed. It is very rare for anything featured on reddit, comment or post, to be shitty enough to be featured here. Do not post reddit screenshots.  
**If you post a picture with the backstory in the title, no story in the image, or the face of a public figure with no story, you will be banned.  This isn't punchablefaces.**

4. **Avoid reposting**.  If you see a repost, report it, preferably with a link to the previous post.  

5. **No news articles. Images, screenshots &amp; gifs only.** Reddit's native hosting and https://imgur.com/upload are preferred.  Please take a screenshot of the article, preferably the title plus a paragraph or two, or link the video through imgur or v.redd.it.  **Screenshots of the headline only will be removed.**  This is because no one reads articles, even in article subreddits; articles rarely get more than 50 upvotes here, and articles inherently include personal info for somebody, which is not allowed in any form about any person.  

6. **No posts featuring gore, animal or child abuse.** Posts featuring gore/child/animal abuse are not allowed here.

---
**Do not report users through modmail**, use the report button with a custom reason.  The only exception is for reporting people who are actually doxxing or other immediate threats.  Do not report people for being mean to you, arguing, or making comments which you disagree with.  If you abuse the report button or modmail, you will be banned.  **If you ask for someone who follows the rules to be banned, you may be banned.**

Posts with bad titles will be automatically removed, you can then resubmit with a better title.  No, you cannot edit your post title or image once it's been created, and neither can the mods.

#[Rules](/r/SquaredCircle/wiki/rules)
Rule | Description
:--|:--
**Our Mission Statement** | [Clear rules](/r/SquaredCircle/wiki/rules) that help give the subreddit a balance of content. -- In addition please follow [redditquette](/wiki/reddiquette) and reddit's site-wide [rules](/rules). 
**Spoiler Policy** | No spoilers in titles for 24 hours after a show has aired. -- If your post contains spoilers put the tag [SPOILERS] at the START of your title and the show title.
**Posts must be about wrestling**|""All link posts must be directly related to wrestling. Any link post not featuring wrestling itself, or in relation to a wrestling show or the wrestling industry, is subject to removal. 
**No image posts that are:** |memes/image macros i.e. an image with text on it done for comedic effect or with slight variation for the sake of a cheap laugh (if it can be found on /r/AdviceAnimals it doesn't belong here) or observations better suited to a text post.
**Don't reply as a new post** | If you want to fix someone's post, or have a better example of what's been posted, tell us so in the comments, not by making a new post!
**No spam** |Only link to your own content if you contribute to the community.
**Reposts and vague titles** | Obvious reposts and titles that are overly ambiguous will be deleted at the moderators' discretion. (e.g. ""This Guy""). Reposts generally follow a 120 day rule except for posts in our [Hall of fame](https://www.reddit.com/r/SquaredCircle/comments/hvgchm/hall_of_fame_posts_induction_1_explanation_of/)
**No Low-Effort Content** | Low-effort, single image **link posts**, including but not limited to, screenshots, crude photoshops, and MS paint-style artwork, are subject to removal. However, these may be posted as a self post with a description of the content.
**No ""Plot""/Sexual Content** | Posts focused on sexual content will be removed. /r/WrestleWithThePlot and /r/WrestleWithThePackage are better places for this content.
**[Meta] posts** | Posts or submissions about the community itself are allowed as long as they follow the general rules of Squared Circle.
**Text posts** | A text post should have sufficient text in its body to either strengthen the title, create discussion or add more information. Any posts posted seemingly for no reason but to bait, troll, or otherwise antagonize the community can and will be removed at the mods discretion.
**No Fake News**  |/r/SquaredCircle has a very strict policy towards troll rumors (fake injury reports, releases, etc.) and those responsible for posting them are subject to being banned.
**Moderator Discretion** | At any time the moderators will use discretion on any given rule. If they feel it's significant or unique to be up despite the rules. On the other hand, they also reserve the right to remove any post they feel breaks the rules. All of this can of course be appealed by messaging us.

/r/HermanCainAward/,430613.0,"**Disclaimer:**

The moderators take a no-tolerance view in regards to brigading. It is strictly forbidden according to reddit's TOS and those caught doing so are subject to a permanent ban.

Additionally, /r/HermanCainAward is not affiliated nor associated with any external Herman Cain Award body on any other site. The Herman Cain Freedom Award is not endorsed by any Herman Cain, living, dead, or undead.

**The Herman Cain Freedom Award**

**Mission Statement:**

This subreddit serves as a statement to the danger and effect that misinformation can and does have. The creator and moderators of /r/HermanCainAward look forward to the day when there are no more nominees, and no more recipients. We actively encourage vetted Immunized to Prevent Award (IPA) posts. Anyone who visits here and decides to get vaccinated is our stated goal.

**Qualifications for nomination:**

 - Public declaration of one's anti-mask, anti-vax, or Covid-hoax views.

 - Admission to hospital for Covid.

 - Someone who posts anti-vax, anti-mask, or anti-Covid views and subsequently posts about someone other than themselves being hospitalized does not qualify.
 

**Qualifications for award:**

 - Award is granted upon the nominee's release from their Earthly shackles.

**Rules:**

1. ""Regret only"" posts do not belong here.

2. Don't be a dick.  Don't root for nominees to be awarded.

3. Memes and shitposts are reserved for ""Shitpost Sunday"".

4. Please check for dupes, as dupe posts will likely be removed.

5. Posts about non-public figures must redact the entire name(s) of everyone in every image. Block it out completely. Don't scribble and allow redacted names to leak through. Profile pictures are not allowed and must be blocked out.


6. If the post contains a picture of a minor's face, the picture must be censored in order to have the post approved.

7. Do not post about finding or visiting the nominees' or awardees' FB pages. That is considered brigading and is strictly against reddit's TOS.

**To expand on Rule 1:**

Nominees / recipients must have a history of PUBLIC statements that are anti-vax, anti-mask, etc.

The statements must have been made public prior to that person receiving hospital care.

""Public Statements"" include media appearances / interviews, social media posts, opinion pieces in print media, etc. Post-hospitalization second-hand statements made by friends / relatives do not count.

Posts that are strictly political in nature, or that do not express the above declaration, are subject to removal, as they do not fit this subreddit.

**Suffering the consequences of believing Covid misinformation is not sufficient to merit a nomination / award.**

Propagation of Covid misinformation, or public declaration of being anti-vaxx / anti mask is necessary.

""Regret Only"" posts fit better in /r/LeopardsAteMyFace.

 Please help us enforce this rule by reporting offending submissions. Please include a link to the original reddit submission in your report or modmail if you have it.

2. **No Reaction, Meme, HIFW, Analogy, Cake Day, or Upvote GIFs.** There are already subreddits more suited for this kind of content. (This rule does not apply to comments)

3. **Do not post GIFs that should be videos.** Incredibly long gifs, subtitles, large file size gifs, or content much better suited to video formats will be removed (e.g multiple cuts, sound, text boxes, subtitles in the GIF).  **Duration must be twenty seconds or less.  †**

4. **Direct image links REQUIRED**. No links to image pages or albums are allowed, your submission must be a single GIF image. **Direct links that end in .gif, .gifv, .ogg, .mp4, and .webm format only.** URL-shorteners are **NOT** allowed in posts or comments!

5. **No depictions of real-life harassment or assault.** There are other subreddits dedicated to this kind of content.

6. **No witch-hunts or brigading.** Do not encourage any online or real-life harassment, and don't encourage people to downvote other posts/comments. 

7. ***No nudity, pornography, gore, or other NSFW material.***  **These are not allowed in posts or comments - No exceptions.** If it can get you fired then it should not be here. Failure to comply will result in removal of post and banning. There are other subreddits dedicated to NSFW content. **Mark risqué posts and comments as NSFW.** (Please note that NSFW tags do not cover the aforementioned content.)

8. **Titles must be descriptive.** We encourage clever titles. Joking and non-literal titles are fine. However, posts with overused, overly vague, or click-bait titles may be removed, and repeated false claims of ownership may result in a ban.

9. **No hate speech of any kind.** Racist, sexist, homophobic, or otherwise abusive submissions or comments will result in an immediate ban.

10. **Please familiarize yourself with the [official rules](http://www.reddit.com/rules/) and [reddiquette](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette).** We will remove any posts violating reddit's official rules (spam, personal information, vote manipulation, etc.) and reddiquette just makes reddit a better place to visit.

**† We may allow multiple cuts and/or GIFs up to a minute long depending on the popularity of a post. Sound, text boxes, and GIFs that heavily depend on captions are still not allowed.**

&amp;nbsp;

**Please Note:** Bot accounts are not allowed. Low-effort novelty accounts that do not constructively contribute content or add to discussion (e.g., trolling, counting, modifying parent comments, correcting someone's grammar, etc.) are not allowed on /r/GIFs.

##Rules
##### *hover for details*

######[](#space)

- All posts must have a TL;DR at the end.  Some of us are too lazy to read your story, sorry.

######[](#space)

######[](#space)
&gt; ### 3.  Must be your fault. No victim blaming. No TIFU by getting 
- robbed
- scammed

- etc

&gt; Those are not your fault.  **Those are not your fault.** Just because something bad happened to you doesn't mean it's your fault.

######[](#space)

Malicious compliance is the act of intentionally inflicting harm by strictly following orders or rules, knowing that compliance with the orders or rules will not have the intended result. The term usually implies the following of an order in such a way that ignores the order or rules's intent but follows its letter. It is usually done to injure or harm while maintaining a sense of legitimacy.

While writing your stories, please make sure to explain why the result is something you'd like to happen. If you can't figure out why you're so happy about the situation, just make sure it's clear that you don't like the person, company, or group that suffered as a result of your flawless victory. Trust me, stories that explain that their boss is a dick or the snotty mom from down the street had it coming are just much more enjoyable to read.

Rules:

1. All posts must be a story that must contain some form of malicious compliance. Malicious is interpreted broadly, but posts where people do not comply with rules will be removed. Update posts must link to the previous post on this subreddit and are subject to moderator approval.

2. No stories involving the following banned elements: Death of anyone, Historical Figures, Fantasy Creatures, Schools (school employees and university students are okay), Complier involuntary bodily functions, or Malicious Compliance with subreddit rules. Also do not thank or reference Youtubers/Influencers. Please ask the moderators if you’re unsure.

3. Don't question the validity of a story. It's much more fun if we give people the benefit of the doubt.

4. Original content only. If it’s not yours then do not post it and do not comment it. You may link to where the owner posted it if you can find it. You do not own the words of other people. You do not own random photos you found online. You do not own Calvin &amp; Hobbes.

5. Comments must forward the discussion. A comment that only insults without prompting further discussion will be removed. Those requesting a user be banned who breaks no rules may be banned themselves at mod discretion.

6. It must be clear that whoever is complying is doing so intentionally. Animals and malfunctioning computers are not allowed. Stories involving children must be from the child’s perspective (your story or a story someone told you from their childhood about something they did) or an adult maliciously complying in a way that involves a child (such as a parent using a loophole to skirt a school rule).

7. Include the fallout. Wait until expected fallout has occurred before sharing. You must also have maliciously complied, not just thought about how you want to. If you’re expecting to have an update, wait until that later date. If additional fallout occurs later, you may be able to update, but it should be a surprise.

8. No Acronyms As Names. Don't make up acronyms for your post. Don't use acronyms from another subreddit. Generally known acronyms are fine. Use industry terms if you like, but explain what they mean.

**We may take any action, including banning, for the first infraction of any rule!**

* Excessively derogatory comments unrelated to Trash^TM are not allowed.
* Bullying is not allowed. 
* Toxic behavior of any kind is banned. 
* To extend the rule above, heated ""social justice"" wars are not allowed on this subreddit. This rule encompasses the following hot-button topics: gender, trans*, rape, child support and alimony, race, ""cultural marxism"", slut shaming, fat positivity, Men's Rights, feminism, and anything related. If you feel the need to climb onto the soapbox about one of these issues, find one of the dozens of threads that pop up about it on every large sub, every day. You are not going to enact social change by having an impassioned discussion on a sub that champions people pissing in public. 
* No witch hunts.
* Do not direct link any personal information or social media profiles

# Rule 2: **Submissions must be appropriate for this subreddit.**
* Posts must be a **CELEBRATION** of trashiness, posts about horrible people doing horrible things without a shred of humorous trashiness to them will be removed and you may be banned. 
* No images of those whose ""trashiness"" is clearly the result of a serious mental illness.
* No pictures of people in healthcare settings (e.g. doctor's office, hospital, clinic waiting room) that they didn't take and post publicly themselves (aka no doctor's office creepshots).
* No porn unless it is excessively trashy.
* No child abuse or animal abuse. 
* No child porn.
* No fake trash. 
* No pictures of literal trash, bathrooms, pee, poop, discarded tampons etc
* No posts of horrible, evil, really awful things like gore or death or torture etc.
* No reposts.
* No license plates.
* Remove all family names / usernames from submissions. Any information that can be used to find the subjects posted here is banned.
* All NSFW posts must be marked NSFW.
* No memes / image macros. This includes social media status updates consisting **solely** of memes / image macros.
* Posts must be Trashy^TM of their own accord, context is helpful but not sufficient to make it Trashy^TM.
* **Please make an effort with your title**.
* All social media posts that do not include a photo **must include the comments**.

* No mass-produced novelty items such as bumper stickers, window decals or commonly posted t-shirt designs. 

* [Trashy Tumblr](https://internetdumpsterfires.tumblr.com/)

/r/DuggarsSnark/,134138.0,"**Subreddit Rules**

1. No Fans:
This forum exists to point out the Duggar's shitty behavior. Users are allowed to mock, deride, and criticize the Duggars. Duggar positive comments that support the ideology are not allowed.

Stand alone complimentary comments such as, “They look great” or “She is absolutely glowing” will be removed.

2. Repeat Post:
Search before you post and sort by new. Utilize reddit's gallery image feature to post multiple pictures from social media to cut down on reposts.

3. No Bigotry:
We want this subreddit to be welcoming to everyone, from all walks of life, unlike the Duggars. Therefore, we have a zero tolerance policy towards content that is racist, sexist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist, or xenophobic. Users will be permanently banned for breaking this rule.

4. Personal Attacks
Personal attacks against other users and moderators are strictly prohibited. We are here to snark on the Duggars, not each other. This rule also includes to harassing each other in private.

Contacting a company that has partnered with the Duggars, however, is fine. Please never use last names of Duggar adjacent people who are not public figures.

6. No Gatekeeping/Meta Posts:
Posts and comments about the state of the sub will be removed, please bring complaints or suggestions to modmail.

7. No Rape Jokes:
No rape jokes.

---

**The sidebar is a summary. [Please see our full rules wiki page.](/r/pcgaming/wiki/postingrules) Mouse over for futher details.**
##  **Rule 0: Be civil**

&gt; No personal attacks, witch-hunts, or inflammatory language. This includes calling or implying another redditor is a shill.

&gt; No racist, sexist, homophobic, transphobic or other hateful language.

&gt; No trolling or baiting posts/comments.

&gt; No calls for violence against any groups or individuals.

&gt; Any account less than 90 days old may be permanently banned on the first infraction of this rule.

##  **Rule #1: No spam, porn, or facilitating piracy**

&gt; This can result in an immediate ban.

&gt; [**Please see our full rules on self-promotion here.**](/r/pcgaming/wiki/selfpromotion)

&gt; [**Please see our full rules on piracy here.**](/r/pcgaming/wiki/piracy)

## **Rule #2:  No affiliate, referral links, or ads**

&gt; This includes Amazon, GMG tap links, Star Citizen, etc.

&gt; Ads include chat/game server recruitment (i.e. Discord), and will be removed.

&gt; **Devs, want to advertise your game or conduct an AMA? [Get verified!](/r/pcgaming/wiki/developers)**

##  **Rule #3: No memes, PCMR language, or low-effort posts/comments**

&gt; This includes contextless images/screenshots/GIFs as well as anti-platform or PCMR language such as ""master race"" and calling people peasants.  

&gt; Low effort posts/comments and submissions not attempting to create discussion are prohibited. This also includes game suggestion posts not following a proper format.

##  **Rule #4: No tech support or game help questions**

&gt; Tech support questions can be posted in our stickied tech support thread.

&gt; General game related discussion is allowed, but game-specific help requests (how to defeat a certain boss or level, what loadout is best for my character, etc) and basic questions (is a game co-op, does this game have controller support, etc) aren't. Those questions would be more appropriate for the game's subreddit if it exists.

##  **Rule #5:  No questions about building/buying computers, hardware, peripherals, furniture, etc**

&gt; This includes ""Can my PC run this?"" type questions, links showing off your computer build, or asking questions about builds.

&gt; Use /r/buildapc for all PC building questions. You can also try /r/buildapcforme, /r/SuggestALaptop, /r/headphones, /r/monitors, /r/mechanicalkeyboards, and /r/mousereview for more specific questions.

##  **Rule #6: No friend requests, surveys, or begging**

&gt; This includes group/clan recruitment. Our Discord has channels for finding people to play with.

&gt; We no longer allow surveys. You can try /r/samplesize.

&gt; Please don’t make requests for spare game keys or PC parts. GoFundMe and other fundraising posts are also prohibited.

##  **Rule #7: No Let's Plays, streams, highlight reels or random videos**

&gt; In addition to this, Youtube links posted by new accounts are filtered due to channel spamming.

##  **Rule #8: No off-topic posts/comments**

&gt; Keep posts and comments related to PC gaming and the topic being discussed.

## **Rule #9: Use the original source, no editorialized titles, no duplicates**

&gt; Submissions must use the original source.

&gt; Don't editorialize your titles.

&gt; No duplicates.

## **Game Suggestion Post Format**

&gt; Please follow the basic format found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/wiki/postingrules#wiki_game_suggestion_request_format) when making game suggestion requests. The more specific you are, the more we can help.

**Hey chefs, check out our totally awesome rules and features right ⬇ below ⬇**
----
* Rules

* Praise Jesus

* Copy and paste content instead of just linking to it. Please do not make the entirety of your copypasta your title with only a link to the source in the self post. Your title should be a quote from the pasta or the overall idea of what it represents. The body of the self post should contain the pasta.

* Emoji copypastas are 💯% OK 👍👍👍👌👌👌

* Sentences with clap emojis inserted in between are low effort and will be removed.

* Check if someone already posted it. Use the search feature and enter a couple of keywords to see if anything comes up.

* Copypasta should be accessible and easy to copy and paste without extra hassle. Always copy a comment with formatting intact (This includes new lines and paragraph breaks). Use [""source"" on RES](http://i.imgur.com/yOMlQYJ.png) to avoid stuff like linked ""[1]"" and ""[2]""

* Do not add quotation blocks in your copypasta. [Example.](http://i.imgur.com/uJhPTcL.png).

* Please label original content as [OC] or the commenters will spam about the source.

* Copypasta which takes advantage of /u/CummyBot2000 in any way, shape or form is strictly prohibited and violators will be banned. This includes ninja-editing to make it look like cummy is saying something different than the OP post.

* Posts that contain ""For every upvote I will ____"" and other upvote begging posts will be removed as they are not copypasta and the posters will be banned

* Posts along the lines of ""X but with Y replaced"" are considered low effort and may be removed. 

* Make sure to tag posts with the spoiler tag and use the spoiler tag for comments. The sidebar has examples on how to do this.

* Encouraging brigading or linking to brigading will get you banned. [What is brigading?](https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/36xhxc/what_is_brigading_and_how_do_you_do_it/)

&gt;
- **Generic memes that can apply to more than just programming as a profession**

*****

Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plagueis The Wise? I thought not. It’s not a story the Jedi would tell you. It’s a Sith legend. Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midichlorians to create life… He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying. The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful… the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. Ironic. He could save others from death, but not himself.
*****
*****


##Rules:

##1. No metagaming

##2. Don't be an asshole

##3. Posts must be memes of the Star Wars Prequels.

##4. Posts inappropriate for viewing in public, like at work, must be tagged NSFW.

##5. No politics.

##6. No edgy or inflammatory posts.

##7. No brigading/encouraging brigading.

##8. No encouraging subreddit drama.

##9. No annoying bots or novelty accounts

##10. No short-term reposts

##11. No low-effort posts

##12. No promotion

##13. No misinformation

##14. No spam

*****

##Details: 

1\. No upvote/karma/awards/subscriber related posts. These have become spammy and unoriginal, and give actual, original content less of a chance of being noticed. These posts will be removed. Posts that ask for karma/upvotes, also known as vote manipulation, will result in a post removal and a ban. Cakeday posts also fall under this rule.

2\. No threatening or harassing other users, celebrities, YouTube channels, pet hamsters, etc. This includes being aggressive or impolite to other users, most likely from some sort of disagreement. We do not care who “started it” when a pair of users are acting this way. Just report someone if they are acting that way and we will handle it.

3\. Posts must be, at least loosely, related to star wars prequels. ""Prequel"" refers to any media that takes place before the beginning of A New Hope. This includes new movies made post-Lucas, EU content, and video games. Note that single pictures of a character (e.g. ""Just a picture of Obi-Wan"") do not necessarily count as memes, and may be seen as a violation of Rule 1. Additionally, all posts must make an attempt at humor. All posts must be made *from* prequel-content or *about* prequel content.

4\. Pornographic material is strictly forbidden on this subreddit as it is not an 18+ sub. NSFW posts are simply posts you might not show your grandmother. NSFW posts that are not porn should be marked as NSFW. Kids come here, use your head. If you wouldn’t be comfortable with a 12 year old on their iPad seeing your content, best to mark it NSFW to be safe. In addition to this, do not sexualize minors on this sub. Including that notorious copypasta.

5\. Obi-Wan is not brave enough for politics, nor are we. /r/PrequelMemes is meant to be a refuge from the extreme political divisiveness you see on nearly every Reddit community every day. Even if an issue seems black and white to you, it is not to be discussed on the subreddit. As a result, we don't allow anything that would bring politics in. Politics is a sweeping term that includes international politics, non-political posts related to politicians, or anything else that is at all related to real life politics or social-issues.

6\. No edgy/inflammatory posts. We have the moral high ground. This subreddit is not the place to joke about distasteful content that would offend a large percentage of the user base. This includes those edgy memes that involve autism or school shootings. /r/PrequelMemes is about humor for everyone involved. If your humor is derived from upsetting/mocking others, probably not a good community for you. With that said, we do not simply remove every meme that someone might disagree with.

7\. Brigading, in reddit terms, is the encouragement of mass downvoting and invading of another subreddit. This is forbidden by Reddit's TOS, and, likewise, our rules. Brigading includes linking to subreddits and telling people to downvote their content. This also extends to things outside of reddit, like polls, videos, etc. Basically anything that constitutes a call to action. Brigading coordinated from /r/PrequelMemes or in the name of /r/PrequelMemes is subject to any repercussions on this sub.

8\. Do not encourage or incite subreddit drama. This includes trying to start “meme wars”, trashtalking other subreddits, and encouraging others to start a war. Keep in mind that wars can only be started by the subreddit moderators, and has to be mutually agreed to by the other subreddit’s mods. Very similar to rules 6 and 7, but also applies internally to causing drama in /r/PrequelMemes. Causing drama could include being intentionally aggressive to other users, baiting users into breaking rules, etc.

9\. No accounts, bot or novelty, that spam the sub or otherwise only occupy space on the sub without offering any actual merit. If your bot gets banned and you are willing to change it to meet our requirements, use mod mail to find out what needs to be changed.

10\. Here are the requirements for reposts:

* Posts must be at least 6 months old before you can repost them

* It also must be 6 months since the last time it was posted 

* All reposts must be flaired to indicate as such

* OP must provide the source of the original in the comments

11\. This one is pretty simple. Post good memes that will make people laugh. Give it a good title. For the title, if you can't think of anything, slap on a loosely-related prequel quote and you are golden. Also, don’t put the caption in the title; the post must be a meme on its own if it didn’t have the title. This rule also prohibits screenshots. This includes text conversations showing someone's reaction to a meme and pictures of polls with the “I love democracy” macro slapped below it.

12\. Do not do anything that constitutes advertising or promoting anything not officially associated with the subreddit. This includes posting links to them, giving instructions on how to find them, etc. This rule generally prohibits store pages, Youtube channels, Instagram accounts, other subreddits, and discord servers, although [there are exceptions](https://old.reddit.com/r/PrequelMemes/wiki/rules#wiki_exceptions11)

13\. Do not convey rumors in a way that would lead people to believe they are factual. Do not spread information you know to be false. If something might not be true, make that clear in your post. This includes anything from leaks to unofficial sources of information.

14\. I cannot believe we need to make this a rule. It should be obvious. Do not post the same thing multiple times. Do not post a comment multiple times. Do not promote scams.

[See the full rules, complete with examples, exceptions, and consequences, for more details.](https://old.reddit.com/r/PrequelMemes/wiki/rules)

&gt; ### [Submission Guidelines](https://www.reddit.com/r/manga/wiki/guide#wiki_submission_guidelines)

&gt;&gt; All posts that are directly related to a series **require the series' title** in the title of the post.

&gt;&gt; For manga related news, use the [News] tag in your post

&gt;&gt; For art, use the following **[Art] Title of Choice (Name of the source Series)**. Manga panel crops or full pages and manga related fanart (remember to include the source in a comment) both fall under the [art] tag.

&gt;&gt; For Discussion submissions, please use the following link syntax: **[DISC] name of manga (chapter#) or (general questions: who's your favorite character? etc.)** Simple questions are not discussions and thus do not need the [DISC] tag.

&gt;&gt; If you are recommending manga (RT! = Read This!), please use the following:  **[RT!] name of manga (genres)** and be liberal with genres! Keep in mind that this is a recommendation from you to all of r/manga, so tell us why we should read it in your post!

&gt;&gt; **[SL]** for posts directly regarding or relating to Scanlation.

&gt;&gt;  If you're asking the entire community a question, put  **r/manga** in the link title.

**READ THE RULES:**

RULES | Description
---|---
**1 - Reposting is prohibited** | *Re-posting is not tolerated. It's annoying. Find something else to post or don't post it at all. Reposting anything from the [album of common reposts](https://imgur.com/a/RZDb87E) may result in a seven day ban.*
**2 - Copypastas are banned** | *Copypastas are BANNED! Any post where the ""cursed content"" is copypasta will be removed.*
**3 - No unmarked NSFW** | *Any unmarked NSFW posts will result in a 3 day ban.*
**4 - Asshole** | *Refrain from being an asshole. It's quite simple and we have a low threshold for asshole post removals. Examples include being discriminating or outright abusive. This includes subtle attempts at racism, homophobia, transphobia, and misogyny.*
**5 - Don't post content from shock accounts** | *Refrain from posting comments from ""shock accounts"" i.e accounts that specifically post ""cursed content""(/u/SatansLilCumrag666, /u/MagicFart69, etc.)*
**6 - Don't submit your own content** | *You cannot create and upload your own content. If the OP in the ""cursed content"" is the same OP that is posting it, it will be removed.*
**7 - Submissions must feature a comment** | *The primary element of your post must be a comment or a piece of cursed content which is otherwise textual communication between two or more people, such as a text message. Submitting a comment that isn't this may result in a 7 day ban.*
**8 - Keep it cursed** | *A cursed comment is any comment that strikes the reader into oblivion. Upon seeing a cursed comment, your first reaction should be among the lines of “What the F*$k did I just read??” while leaving you speechless at the same time. Incomprehension of the comment just read, or the blatant gruesomeness of it should be enough to not only make you feel mystified but also to draw a smile on your face. Low effort submissions may also be removed* 
**9 - Deepfrying is prohibited** | *Deepfried memes are not tolerated. If your post is garbage enough where you need to deepfry it for humor, don't post it.*
**10 - Moderator Discretion** | *Moderators may use discretion to upkeep the quality of the subreddit. Obviously fake or otherwise unsuitable content may be removed.*
**11 - Submission titles must begin with Cursed_** | *eg. Cursed_Potato.*
**12 - Sexualization or harm of minors** | *Submissions and comments must not be of pedophiliac character or involve the sexualization or extreme physical harm of minors. Failure to do so may result in the ban of the user for the duration of 10 days.*

#### **[Allowed submissions](https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/wiki/rules)**
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;* News and articles
&gt;* Reviews and previews
&gt;* Informative self-posts
&gt;* Questions likely to generate discussion

###### **[Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/wiki/rules)**
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;1. No content primarily for humor or entertainment
&gt;2. No personal attacks, witch hunts, bigotry, or inflammatory language
&gt;3. No off-topic or low-effort content or comments
&gt;4. No duplicate posts
&gt;5. No enabling or linking to piracy
&gt;6. Follow all [formatting requirements](https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/wiki/rules#wiki_rule_6_-_formatting_requirements)

&gt;8. Promotion must be kept within [acceptable limits](https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/wiki/rules#wiki_rule_8_-_promotional_content_requirement)

##### Promotion
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Some promotional submitting (posting your own projects, articles, etc.) is permitted, but it must be balanced out by a *much* greater level of non-promotion participation in reddit - the rule of thumb is no more than 10% of your submissions may be promotional. **[Do not solicit votes for your posts](http://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/13ti3e/mowing_the_astroturf/).** For more information, [see the self-promotion on reddit FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion).
&gt;
&gt;**If you want to promote without participating in the community, [purchase an ad](https://www.redditinc.com/advertising)**.

##### Spoilers
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Please report posts containing spoilers unless they are hidden using the following method or are inside a thread clearly labeled as containing spoilers.
&gt;
&gt;Format: `**Spoiler:** &gt;!X Kills Y!&lt;`  
&gt;Result: **Spoiler:** &gt;!X Kills Y!&lt;

&gt;Posting unmarked spoilers will result in removal and warning, and posting spoilers with malicious intent will result in a ban.

&gt;*Recommending products not in the whitelist might result in your comment or post being removed and a ban imposed. If you want anything added please message the mods and we will consider it.*

&gt;**6: No [Meta] Posts About Tech/Jobs**

&gt;*No [Meta] posts about jobs (tech support related or not) or technology in general, such as ""I have an interview, help me."" or ""I want a product that can do XYZ."" or ""How does the internet work?""*

&gt;Google is your friend.

&gt;**7: No Private Messages or Moving to Another Service**

&gt;*Any and all communication not kept public and is moved away from the subreddit or Discord/IRC channel is prohibited.*

&gt;*Do not suggest or ask to move to another service or to private message. Private messages and other services are unsafe as they cannot be monitored. Doing so will cause you to be permanently banned from /r/TechSupport.*

&gt;**8: No Violating privacy of others or terms/agreements.**

&gt;We do not support users that violates other's privacy or breaks terms and agreements. Doing so might resolve in a ban.

&gt;This includes:

1. Bypassing home network controls.

2. Bypassing any parental controls.

3. Piracy or issues caused by it.

4. Gray market product codes - See Rule 1

5. Any other posts/comments that violates or breaks terms and agreements.

&gt;**No EOL Software or Unsupported Systems**

&gt;We do not provide support for EOL (end of life) software. Software that is EOL has lost all support from the developer and therefore all consumer communities as well.

&gt;These operating systems and various softwares are no longer receiving security patches. Running them is unsafe and we recommend users install a supported version as soon as possible.

&gt;This list includes Windows XP, Vista, and 7.

&gt;We will also not assist with getting Windows 11 running on unsupported hardware.


&gt;**Rule 10: No Public Service Announcements (how-to's, etc.)**

&gt;*No public service announcements unless relevant to an issue (it must be a comment). Approach the communities affected directly, not here*


&gt;**11: No Soliciting**

&gt;*No soliciting of any kind. This includes (but is not limited to) asking for us to link to your subreddit, forum, bulletin board, newsgroup, Facebook page, etc. We're here to help with technical issues, not market for others.*

&gt;**12: No spam, trolling, insults, jokes, threats of self-harm, or posts unrelated to Tech Support**

&gt;*Posts and comments containing (but not limited to) the following will be removed:  
blog spam, link spam, referral spam, joke responses, memes, novelty accounts, trolling, unethical behavior, and personal insults.*

&gt;*Posts not containing a tech support issue will be removed. Off-topic comments will be removed. Please stick to the issue being addressed in the post. Use common sense.*

&gt;**13: No Posts/Comments by a Company or an Employee on Behalf of a Company**

&gt;*Employees of companies with social media presences for marketing, damage control, or performing of tech support are not allowed.*

&gt;**14: No Potentially Malicious Links**

&gt;*Do not post any potentially malicious links. We will consider Dropbox links, Google Drive links, or Google Photos links to be potentially malicious.*

&gt;*We recommend against using any URL shorteners as they can hide malicious links.*

/r/nottheonion/,20346603.0,"**Review current posts to avoid reposting.**

For **true stories** that are so mind-blowingly ridiculous, that you could have sworn it was an [Onion story](http://theonion.com/).

[](/spikeholdup) Please note that we are an editorialized subreddit based on what we feel meets our subjective quality and humour guidelines as curators of this subreddit. Most submissions do not make the cut, and please do not treat removals under rule 2 as a personal attack, they simply happen with our content model.

### Rules - **[hover or click here for full version](https://www.reddit.com/r/nottheonion/wiki/expanded)**

|||
|:------|:-----|
|1. Do not alter headlines; copy and paste. | The title of all submissions needs to match the article headline exactly.  **Copy and paste** from the main headline only, do not include anything beyond the primary headline such as byliners, subtitles, flavor text, quotes from the article, news outlet, location, cross post tags, (video) tags, and so on.  Do not use the “suggest title” option for posting as it often does not match the headline.  As a matter of fairness, any submission with an altered title will be removed.  The **only exception** is that, if an article has a title in **all caps**, you may change the capitalization to title case, but everything else must remain the same.|
|2. Submit only if “Oniony”. | Please consider submitting your article to /r/offbeat or similar subreddits unless it truly reads like The Onion wrote it. The title and article itself must both be ""Oniony"". This can be highly subjective; you are encouraged to upvote articles that should be here and downvote those that should not.  Moderators can also remove posts at their own discretion under this rule.  [More here](https://www.reddit.com/r/nottheonion/wiki/done_to_death)|
|3. Must be a news article. | Submissions must be in the form of a news article.  Videos are only allowed if they are accompanied by a complete text article.  Editorials, blogs, twitter posts, image galleries, tabloid stories, youtube videos, meta posts, static images, articles with fewer than 5 sentences, and so forth will be removed.|
|4. Use original, reliable sources. | Find the source of your story before you submit it, simply by checking for references or googling the subject to locate the original piece.  Websites that frequently re-host viral news stories or contain misleading information are on [automatic removal](https://www.reddit.com/r/nottheonion/wiki/autoremoval).  Blogs are not reliable sources.|
|5. Do not repost similar articles. | Check the sub for your story before you submit it; if it’s already here then please vote and comment there instead of posting another version.  Similar stories will be removed and frequent re-posters will lose their posting privileges.  Do not delete and repost your own submissions without approval.|
|6. No satire articles. | Even if they are technically from a source other than _The Onion_, any article submission written as satire or even true stories written in a satirical manner are not allowed.  Please note that some major news outlets have satirical sections, such as the Borowitz Report on the New Yorker, which are also not allowed.  Meanwhile, AVClub, while owned by The Onion, is not satire and is allowed. If you'd like, you can use a tool like http://realorsatire.com/ to see if your submission is from a known satirical website.|
|7. No tabloid journalism. | Do not post tabloid news stories, or articles that source from tabloid news outlets (TheSun, Mirror, Dailymail, People, TMZ, etc).|
|8. No old news. | Articles need to have been written within two weeks of its submission date.|
|9. English articles only. | Please do not post non-English articles.  Do not use google translate for submission either; rather try to find an English version of the story by a secondary source.|
|10. No mobile versions. | If you’re using a mobile device to post a story make sure you remove any mobile identifiers (typically “.m” or “mobile”) from the url before submitting.|
|11. No blocked or redirected links. | Please ensure you aren’t submitting a link that utilizes a paywall or survey wall (nytimes.com, thetimes.co.uk) in order gain access to the complete article.  Do not submit links that redirect you to another site to read the article and do not submit using link shorteners either.|

/r/LifeProTips/,19978641.0,"**What is a Life Pro Tip?**

A Life Pro Tip (or an LPT) is a specific action with definitive results that improves life for you and those around you in a specific and significant way.

**Keep in mind that giving someone advice is not the same as giving someone a LPT.** Advice is offering someone guidance or offering someone a recommendation.

Examples of advice:

 “Always be prepared to leave your employer because they are prepared to leave you.”

“A marriage proposal should not come as a big surprise, despite what you may have seen in the movies.”

**Keep in mind that an aphorism is not a LPT.**

An aphorism is a a short clever saying that is intended to express a general truth or a concise statement of a principle.

Examples of aphorisms:

""A barking dog never bites.""

""No snowflake in an avalanche ever feels responsible.""

""All stones are broken stones.""

---

**RULES:**

1. No rude, offensive, racist, homophobic, sexist, aggressive or hateful posts/comments.
2. Posts must begin with ""LPT"" or ""LPT Request” and be flaired. Titles must be descriptive. The tip and the problem it solves must be explained thoroughly. 
3. Tag tips for adult audiences as NSFW.
4. Do not post tips that could be considered common sense, common courtesy, unethical, or illegal.
5. Do not post tips that are based on spurious, unsubstantiated, or anecdotal claims.
6. Posts concerning the following are not allowed: religion, politics, relationships, law and legislation, parenting, driving, medicine or hygiene (including mental health).
7. Do not post tips in reaction to other posts. Reposts may be removed.
8. Do not post tips that are advertisements or recommendations of products or services.
9. Posts or comments that troll and/or do not substantially contribute to the discussion may be removed.

Note that moderators will use their own discretion to remove any post that they believe is low-quality or not considered a LPT.

---

**BANNING POLICY:**

Bans are given out immediately and serve as a warning.

You may appeal this initial ban by messaging the moderators and agreeing not to break the rules again. 
You must acknowledge the rule you broke!


Note: Bans will not be reversed if the post/comment in question has been deleted from your history."
